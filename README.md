# EnewaldLisp

The aim of this project was to create a Turing complete programming language for general purpose programming with embedded Linux and system administration as the focal points. I may return someday to finish it, but I think I will use different set of tools.

## Features

- parsing of s-expressions
- arithmetic
- calling external shell scripts
